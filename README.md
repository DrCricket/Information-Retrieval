=====================

Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLCs) are based on expert systems, which employ fuzzy logic.
FLCs make use of rules, rather than equations to make computations.
For the controller designed in this project, we have written 4 rules of the IF-THEN format, popularly referred to as the Mamdani type rules.
It is a direct controller, wherein the FLC is in the forward path in a feedback control system.
